### About Me

I am a recent Cairo University computer science graduate, bringing a year of professional experience as a programming instructor for 16-year-old students. My passion lies in building robust and user-friendly applications from scratch to production.

Skilled in **Laravel**, **Spring**, **Flutter**, and **Database Design**, I excel at analyzing user requirements, designing efficient database schemas, and developing intuitive interfaces. Through freelancing projects, I have honed my abilities to deliver high-quality, production-ready applications.

#### Key Experiences

- **Programming Instructor**: Taught programming to 16-year-old students, fostering their problem-solving skills and nurturing their passion for technology.

- **Freelance Projects**: Worked on multiple projects, gaining hands-on experience in full-stack development, from requirement analysis and database design to front-end and back-end implementation, as well as cloud deployment.
